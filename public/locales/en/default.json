This week‚Äôs focus was all about making sure we‚Äôre starting from the freshest and most secure foundation.\n\nWhat we did\n\nUpdated each of the main components (think of them as the ‚Äúorgans‚Äù of our Layer 2 system) ‚Äî OP-Proposer, OP-Node, OP-Batcher, OP-Geth, and OP-Contracts ‚Äî to their latest stable versions.\n\nThis ensures we‚Äôre building on top of the newest features, bug fixes, and security improvements contributed by the broader Optimism/rollup community.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nRunning old software is like trying to build a house on shaky ground. By locking in the latest releases right from the start, we reduce risks and keep things smooth when we begin connecting all the pieces later.\n\nWhat‚Äôs next\n\nNext week, we‚Äôll share how we‚Äôre setting the gas price strategy that will keep transactions fast and cheap while protecting the chain from spam.","dev_update2_1":"Hey Brett fam üëã\n\nThis week we focused on one of the most important things for any Layer 2: transaction costs. Nobody likes paying high gas fees, and one of the big advantages of Layer Brett is that we can make transactions fast and cheap - while still keeping the network safe.\n\nWhat we did\n\nWe drafted our gas price model, which sets the minimum fee you‚Äôll pay to send a transaction on Layer Brett.\n\nThese settings act like a traffic signal: they keep the flow of transactions smooth while making sure the network isn‚Äôt clogged by spam or abuse.\n\nRight now, we‚Äôve kept things conservative - low enough to feel cheap for users, but high enough that someone can‚Äôt flood the system for free.","dev_update2_2":"Why this matters\n\nThink of gas fees as a balance scale. If fees are too high, nobody wants to use the chain. If they‚Äôre too low, the network risks being spammed. Our settings aim for the sweet spot so that Brett holders get speed, affordability, and reliability all at once.\n\nTechnical notes\n\nWe‚Äôve defined a base gas floor (the lowest allowed fee).\n\nParameters can be adjusted later once we see how real transactions behave under load.\n\nThese values will sync across all components (execution, proposer, batcher) so the system stays consistent.\n\nWhat‚Äôs next\n\nNext week, we‚Äôll share how we‚Äôre giving Layer Brett its own unique chain ID - basically its passport in the Ethereum ecosystem, so wallets and apps know exactly which network they‚Äôre talking to.","DoubletheRewards":"Double the Rewards","DoubletheRewards_des":"Stake $LBRETT and earn enhanced rewards, powered by the efficiency of Layer 2 scalability.
